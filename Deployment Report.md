# Deployment Report

1. We need to keep required files in same directory.


2. The required files here are Index.html, style.css, Titanic_app.py and model.pkl


3. Flask is directory sensitive in case of templates. It can raise error in such case. We need to place "Index.html" in "templates" directory.


4. Once we've al files in place we must open console or anaconda console and set directory using the command and run the Titanic_app.py.
